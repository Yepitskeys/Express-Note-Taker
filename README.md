# Express-Note-Taker

## Project Description: 
The goal of this project is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

    * When a user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
    * When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    * When the user enterx a new note title and the note’s text, a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
